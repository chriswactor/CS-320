To ensure my software is functional and secure, I implement comprehensive testing strategies that include unit tests, integration tests, and, where necessary, stress tests to evaluate performance under load. I prioritize secure coding practices to safeguard against common vulnerabilities and regularly update dependencies to mitigate risks. Understanding user needs involves direct communication with stakeholders through interviews, feedback sessions, and usage analytics. This ensures that I can translate these needs into actionable development goals that align with user expectations and software functionality. My approach to designing software starts with a clear definition of requirements and system architecture. I use design patterns that are appropriate to the projectâ€™s scale and complexity, making sure that the software is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to any changes.
